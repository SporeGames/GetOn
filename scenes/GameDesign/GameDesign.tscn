GameDescription = "An online multiplayer battle royale game featuring teams of three players using pre-made characters with distinctive abilities. Each match generally features twenty teams. All teams are then placed on an aircraft that passes over the game map. One player in each team selects when the team should skydive out of the aircraft and where to land with the concurrence of the other squad members. However, players are free to deviate from the team's path. Once on the ground, the team can scavenge for equipment that is scattered around buildings, or in crates randomly distributed around the map.The player has the ability to climb over short walls, slide down inclined surfaces, and use zip-lines to traverse an area quickly. Over time, the game's safe zone will reduce in size around a randomly-selected point on the map; players outside the safe zone take damage and may die if they do not reach the safe zone in time. Players who become knocked down in the course of a game can be revived by their teammates. Should a player be killed completely, they can still be resurrected if their team member(s) collect their respawn banner, which appears at the place where they died, and bring it to one of several beacons on the map. The last team with any members left alive is deemed the winner of that match."

GameDescription = "An adventure game played from a third-person view, which is subject to a set and controllable perspective. There are multiple playable characters who can die as the story continues without them; as a result, there is no \"game over\" message following a character's death. The player is able to interact with objects and observe one's surroundings, move around, and scan the environment for possible actions; the motion controls and touchpad are also employed. Via quick time events and dialogue decisions, the story will branch out depending on which choices are made. These can be viewed in a flowchart during and immediately after a given chapter; the player can rewind to certain points in the story to reshape decisions in the event of regret. Certain scenes feature countdowns, which force quick action. Levels abound with magazines for players to read. The playable characters are:A police investigator android tasked with hunting down androids that have deviated from their programmed behaviors.A housekeeper android who develops artificial consciousness and becomes responsible for a young girl's safety.A caretaker android who, after gaining consciousness, takes it upon himself to free others like him from bondage."

GameDescription = "A single player survival horror game, with the player character visible at all times.The menus are diegetic, opening them does not pause gameplay.The character's RIG (Resource Integration Gear) can be outfitted with two special abilities for use in combat and puzzle-solving \"Kinesis\" & \"Stasis\". The RIG also has a slot-based inventory for carrying weapons, ammunition, healing items, and other objects.Gunplay against Necromorphs which are re-animated and re-purposed corpses, lacking dependence on nervous, respiratory, and circulatory systems, the conventions of causing targets to be incapacitated or immobilized are largely irrelevant to them. Thus, instead of targeting foes' heads or center of mass, players are encouraged to engage in \"strategic dismemberment\" by shooting off their arms and legs. Relatedly, the game's weapons are characterized as being repurposed power tools or mining implements. Ammunition tends to be uncommon, thus necessitating careful usage of the tools at hand.Players can also visit vending machines to buy or sell items for in-game currency, and upload new schematics to those stores in order to unlock new items."

GameDescription = "An action role-playing video game in which the player can switch between a first-person and third-person perspective at any time. The game features an open world in the form of an area within the Milky Way galaxy, containing both fictional and non-fictional planetary systems. As the player explores the game world, they encounter various NPCs, some of whom have the option to join the player's crew. Such NPCs may aid the player in various ways. Each companion character has their own unique skills and abilities. At the start of the game, the player can customize their character. Choosing the background of the player character unlocks three starting skills. As the player progresses, they will unlock additional traits which can aid or hinder them. Traits are removable through quests or certain actions. As the player progresses, they gain experience and level up, allowing them to unlock abilities. Each skill can be ranked up by completing related challenges. A variety of firearms, explosives, and melee weapons can be used to defeat enemies. The player is additionally able to equip various jetpacks. These must be extracted or harvested to fulfill many crafting recipes. Outposts can be erected by the player, which can serve as homes or facilitate resource-extraction operations. The player can install laboratories in their outposts to research craftable items and upgrades. The player can construct, purchase, or commandeer spaceships. At various spaceports located on planets, the player can buy and sell parts and spaceships, or have their own repaired."
