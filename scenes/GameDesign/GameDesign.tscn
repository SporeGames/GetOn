The character's RIG (Resource Integration Gear) can be equipped with two special abilities for use in combat and puzzle-solving \"Kinesis\" & \"Stasis\". 
The RIG also has a slot-based inventory for carrying weapons, ammunition, healing items, and other objects. 

Gunplay against Necromorphs which are re-animated and re-purposed corpses, lacking dependence on nervous, respiratory, and circulatory systems, the conventions of causing targets to be incapacitated or immobilized are largely irrelevant to them. 
Ammunition tends to be uncommon, thus necessitating careful usage of the tools at hand."
